3 - DEVELOPPEMENT PROCESS : 
    - step1 : Create a folder named native_federation
        steph@steph-To-be-filled-by-O-E-M:~/homework_Angular/native_federation
    - step2 - Creation of app host into /homework_Angular/native_federation
        command line:
            ng new host_app
    - step3 - Library installation of native federation into host_app
        cd host_app
        npm i @angular-architects/native-federation@17.0.0
    - step4 - Make this project (host_app) capable of handling federation dynamic-host (--type dynamic-host is meaning that this project aime is to diplay micro front ends)
        ng generate @angular-architects/native-federation:init --project host_app --port 4200 --type dynamic-host
